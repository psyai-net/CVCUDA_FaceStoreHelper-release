## Project Introduction

This project is designed to extract faces from images, perform image restoration/super-resolution operations, and then merge the restored face back into the original image. The code provides a simple, fast, and accurate method for face extraction and merging back into the original image, suitable for various application scenarios.

We have undertaken a comprehensive rewrite of the original OpenCV implementation, replacing all serial CPU operations with their corresponding CVCUDA operators. This optimization enables our project to leverage the power of GPU acceleration, resulting in significantly improved performance and efficiency in computer vision tasks. By harnessing CVCUDA's capabilities, we have successfully enhanced the processing speed of our application, providing a more responsive and robust user experience.

## Features

- Widely applicable for post-processing of face image super-resolution/restoration networks, such as GFPGAN and CodeFormer.

### Usage Example

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

3. Run the script:

Generate resource packs that provide codeformer with the necessary face landmarks and affine transformation matrices
``` shell
python gen_resource_pkg.py
```

inference with cvcuda accelerated codeformer network
``` shell
python cvcuda_facestorehelper.py --input_path = your_images_path
```

4. The program will save the images with extracted faces in the specified path and draw the restored faces on the original images.
